Kathulhu-Framework
==================

Kathulhu-Framework is a Unity3D framework I created to invoke the Elder Gods for their help to accelerate game development during game jams. Ia Ia Kathulhu fhtag'n! You are free to use this framework in any way you want, but I would sure like to know about any bug found or any feature that could be improved upon so don't hesitate to create a pull request or contact me.

For more information on the framework, consult the wiki :
